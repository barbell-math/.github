# Barbell Math
An attempt to make barbell math about more than figuring out what plates should go on the bar. (Although that can be done as well)

There are three repositories in this organization. Each repository fulfills a specific role.
1. book
2. engine
3. test-data

### Book

This is where the majority of the research for the project will be recorded. The book will contain all information regarding how the model is made as well as why it is made that way. It also acts as a 'standard' that describes how the model should be implemented.

### Engine

The engine is the implementation of the model that is described in the book. The engine will use the data collected in the test-data repository.

### test-data

This repository holds the dataset that is used when testing and creating the model. It is responsible for ensuring the data recorded is accurate and catching errors upon data entry.
